============ WELCOME TO MINECRAFT RUST ============
This is a very simple Minecraft clone (mostly) created in one week


Because it was made in a week, some major features were missing:
-Level loading (Chunks do not save! So, I wouldn't commit to a build here for now)
-Caves
-Mobs
-Crafting

However, I did manage to implement some other important things:
-World generation
-Simple resource collection
-Biomes
-Collision detection
-Block breaking/ placing


For now, the game it pretty much entirely a community-driven project.
